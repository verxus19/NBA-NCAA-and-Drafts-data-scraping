# Basketball Data Scraping

The aim of this personal project is to scrape data from different seasons of NBA and NCAA, Drafts and All-Star selections. After that, there are some manipulations and combining on this scraped data and two experiments to try to predict the success of a player in the following years at the moment of the Draft.

The executing order is:
1- scrape_data.ipynb
2- explore_data.ipynb
3- processing_data.ipynb
4- over_15_per_model.ipynb
5- first_all_star_model.ipynb (this one is not documented but is mostly the same as number 4, which is documented properly).
